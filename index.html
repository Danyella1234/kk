    <h2>My Profile</h2>
    <p>I'm Daniella Owens, 17 years old and a student at PAU (Pan Atlantic University), where I'm tackling Information Science and Media Studies (ISMS). 
        But my real passion lies in art. Ever since i was little, I've been doodling and drawing, and now I'm obessed with animation. 
        My dream is to be a professional animatior someday, bringing characters and stories to life through captivating motion grachics.
        I know I'm just starting out, but I'm super excited to keep learning and improving my skills. This Portfolio is a window into my artistic journey so far, 
        and i can't wait to see where it takes me.</p>

The woman in the image could represent someone struggling to stay afloat in a difficult life event, such as a job loss, a breakup, or a personal crisis. She may feel like she's being pulled under by the current, with no control over her circumstances. This could be due to external pressures, such as a demanding work environment or a toxic relationship. Or, she might be grappling with internal challenges, such as anxiety, depression, or grief. Regardless of the source of her struggle, the image captures the sense of powerlessness and despair that can come from feeling like you're drowning.">
